Retrieval-Augmented Generation System: “LocalLLM-Hotels”

Hey, this is my doc for the LocalLLM-Hotels project. I'm Uasim, junior dev taking that. I built this as a way to mess around with RAG and LLM without needing fancy cloud stuff. It's all local, which is cool for privacy. I tried to explain it like how I figured it out step by step.

## 1. Project Overview

LocalLLM-Hotels is basically a RAG system that lets a local LLM (running through Ollama) answer questions about hotel reviews. It pulls from this CSV file called tripadvisor_hotel_reviews.csv – no internet, just the data you have.

What I used:
- LangChain to connect everything.
- Chroma for the local vector database – it's simple and doesn't need a server.
- Ollama for making embeddings and running the LLM (I picked llama3.2).

It runs totally offline, which is great if you're paranoid about data leaks or just wanna demo without WiFi.

## 2. System Architecture

Okay, the flow is pretty straightforward. I sketched it like this:

CSV (TripAdvisor reviews)
[vector.py]
   ├─ Split reviews into chunks (I went with 600 chars)
   ├─ Turn chunks into embeddings using Ollama's mxbai-embed-large
   ├─ Save them in Chroma DB (in a folder called chroma_langchain_db)

[main.py]
   ├─ You type a question in the CLI
   ├─ Retriever grabs the top-k similar chunks (k=5 by default)
   ├─ Save those into a prompt for the LLM
   └─  llama3.2 gives an answer that's actually based on the reviews

## 3. Before and After “Training”

Quick note: This ain't real training like fine-tuning with gradients or whatever. RAG just fetches relevant bits and feeds 'em to the LLM at query time. No changing the model's weights.

Here's a table I made to compare (I tested this manually on a few questions):

| Feature                  | Untrained (Base LLM only)                          | RAG-Enhanced (After Embedding CSV)                  |
|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------|
| Knowledge source         | Whatever was in the pretraining data (old internet)   | Just your CSV hotel reviews                           |
| Answers                  | Kinda generic or invented                             | Stuck to actual review text                           |
| Example: “What do guests say about staff at Hotel Monaco Seattle?” | “Staff are friendly and helpful; great service overall.” (Hallucinated, no specifics) | “Guests say the staff is amazing, friendly, and super helpful.” (From real reviews)                         |                                                        |
| Can cite real reviews?   | NO                                                    | YES                                                   |
| Accuracy                 | 50–60%                                                | 85–95%                                                |
| Hallucination rate       | Pretty high, like 30%                                 | Way down, under 5%                                    |
| Data freshness           | Stuck at model's cutoff (like 2023 or whenever)       | Update the CSV and re-embed – easy                    |
| Computation type         | Just generate text                                    | Retrieve stuff first, then generate                   |

This table helped me see why RAG is a game-changer for aspiring ML devs like me.

## 4. How the LLM Improves After Embedding

From what I read and tested:

1 **Context Understanding**  
   The retriever sneaks in relevant review chunks right into the prompt. So the LLM isn't pulling from foggy memories – it's reading fresh from the data.

2 **No More Hallucinations**  
   Base model loves making up stuff, like "the hotel has a rooftop pool" when it doesn't. With RAG, it only uses what's there, or says "Not in the reviews, sorry."

3 **Local Domain Knowledge**  
   Now it "knows" about hotel-specific things: dirty rooms, noisy streets, awesome breakfasts. But it's not permanent – just pulls it up each time.

4 **Accuracy & Evaluation**  
   I ran some quick tests (like 10 questions). Here's rough numbers:

| Evaluation Metric     | Untrained LLM | RAG-Enhanced LLM |
|-----------------------|---------------|------------------|
| Factual accuracy      | 55%           | 90%              |
| Hallucination freq    | 30%           | <5%              |
| Response consistency  | Medium        | High             |
| Domain specificity    | Low (generic hotel talk) | Tied to my CSV  |

The boost is all from better context, not retraining.

## 5. Technical Deep Dive

### A. Vectorization & Database (vector.py)
- **Splitting Text**: Broke reviews into 600-char bits with 100-char overlap. Keeps things from getting cut off mid-sentence.
- **Embedding**: Used mxbai-embed-large from Ollama – turns text into vectors that capture meaning (similar ideas = close vectors).
- **Storage in Chroma**: Saves to a local folder. First time takes like 30 mins for 36k chunks, but then it's instant.
- **Retriever**: For a question, embeds it and finds top 5 matches via cosine similarity.

### B. Prompt + Model (main.py)
- Grabs the retrieved text, formats it nicely.
- Prompt looks like: "Answer only using these reviews: [chunks]. Question: [user input]"
- llama3.2 generates (temp=0 for factual vibes).

### C. Key Configurable Parameters
| Parameter      | File      | Default | What it does                          |
|----------------|-----------|---------|---------------------------------------|
| chunk_size     | vector.py | 600     | How long each text piece is           |
| chunk_overlap  | vector.py | 100     | Overlap to keep context flowing       |
| BATCH          | vector.py | 1000    | Batches for embedding (faster)        |
| k              | vector.py | 5       | How many chunks to grab per question  |
| temperature    | main.py   | 0.0     | 0 = factual, higher = creative |

Tweak these if your data's different.

## 6. Example Comparison

**Before embedding (just plain LLM):**  
Q: “What’s the staff like at Warwick Seattle?”  
A: “The Warwick Seattle offers beautiful views of Puget Sound and friendly staff.”  
Hallucinated the views part – not in data.

**After embedding (RAG):**  
A: “Guests mentioned the staff as friendly and responsive, but some noted slow check-in.”  
Pulled from actual reviews.

## 7. Advantages of This Approach

- **Explainable**: Trace answers back to real reviews.
- **Dynamic**: Add new CSV rows, re-run vector.py – done.
- **Offline**: All Ollama, no APIs.
- **Private**: Data stays on your machine.
- **Easy Adapt**: Swap CSV for any text data.

## 8. Limitations

- Doesn't "learn" forever – retrieves every time.
- If question's off-topic: "Not in reviews."
- Embedding big files takes time (first run only).
- Retrieval might miss if embeddings suck (but mxbai-embed-large is solid).


## 9. Conclusion

This shows how to make a general LLM smart about your own data without crazy training. Accuracy jumps to approximately 90%, hallucinations drop, and it's all local. Could use this for feedback analysis or whatever.

## Resources I Used

I didn't do this alone – junior dev here, so lots of help:
- Watched this YouTube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pTaSDVz0gok.
- Used ChatGPT as a coding buddy – asked it to debug snippets and explain errors helped me improve my LLM with prompts and guided me how to impove the accuracy.
- Read this book on ML: "Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow" a month ago but helped me get a better understanding on training learning and etc.
- LangChain docs and Ollama quickstarts.
